xt rubbish" can refer to several things, including
nonsensical text generated by a computer, improperly displayed text due to character encoding issues, or unwanted and annoying text messages. It can also describe the poor quality of a text-based digital image or an excessive amount of unneeded formatting when pasting text. 
Technical and digital meanings

    Generated or nonsensical text: In natural language processing (NLP), "rubbish examples" are pieces of text that have been heavily modified to be nonsensical to humans but do not change an AI model's prediction. This is used to test the model's robustness.
    Encoding issues: Text can appear as "rubbish" or a series of random characters if a system is not using the correct character encoding (like UTF-8) to display the language, such as Arabic text not rendering correctly, notes Stack Overflow.
    Poorly formatted text: When pasting text from a source like Microsoft Word, it can include "formatting rubbish" (unwanted, messy formatting) that needs to be cleaned up using a text editor or paste options like "Paste Plain Text".
    Pixelated text: In graphics, "rubbish" can describe jagged or pixelated text, which may be fixed by using anti-aliasing, increasing the canvas size, or changing the file format to one that supports better quality (like PNG over JPEG). 

Annoying or unwanted texts

    Spam or unwanted messages: Unwanted promotional texts, spam, or "junk" messages can be referred to as "rubbish." You can manage these by using built-in phone features like "Filter Unknown Senders" or by blocking sen

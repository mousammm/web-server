# req to res

```c
char* f = buffer + 5;
*strchr(f, ' ') = 0;
```

* currently we only extract path form ( GET /path HTTP/1.1)
* our goal we be to change this to a fun that store all 3 in a struct

```c
typedef struct {
    char method[16];
    char path[256];
    char version[16];
} Req_t;
```
```c
Req_t req = {0};
char buffer[1024] = {0}; 

while(;;){
    .....
    memset(buffer, 0, sizeof(buffer));  // Reset buffer for new request
    parse_req(client_fd, &req);         // path req and save in Req_t 
    .....
}
```

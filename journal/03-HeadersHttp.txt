# Day 3 

OUR server listens for incomming connection 
Client(browser) -> http://localhost:8080/index.html
- browser send a req 
- we can accept it in buffer from clientFile descriptor

	GET /example.txt HTTP/1.1  //Method, Path, Http Version
	Host: localhost:8000
	User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36
	Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
	Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
	Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
	Connection: keep-alive

Now after getting the request in buffer 
we need to send a response

	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Content-Type: text/plain
	Content-Length: 27
	Connection: close
	
	This is the file content!


What browser can send is pre defined
        text/plain → Show as plain text
        text/html → Render as HTML webpage
        image/png → Display as image
        application/json → Show formatted JSON
	application/octet-stream -> Downloads as file

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- if browser know that client want index.html 
- then how come we need to defined the contentt type in response
ANS:  its for the browser convinence so it can do the things it suppose to do
      with the the content like rendering as img html json etc

CODE:

- refactoring
- remove all http function from Server.c to Http.c
- Same for Client fun

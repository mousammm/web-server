# File handling

```c
FILE* file = fopen(req->path, "rb");
fseek(file, 0, SEEK_END);// Get file info
long size = ftell(file);
fseek(file, 0, SEEK_SET);

// Get the MIME type for the requested file
// Build HTTP response
// Send header response

// Send file content
char buffer_file[4096]; // Standard buffer size
size_t bytes_read;
while ((bytes_read = fread(buffer_file, 1, sizeof(buffer_file), file)) > 0) {
    send(client_fd, buffer_file, bytes_read, 0);
}
// Cleanup
fclose(file);
```

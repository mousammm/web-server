# File handling

* heh i have to tell u something 
* actually u know im building, learning, mistakes, improvement 
* so the snend res cycle like getting mime type then sending header 
* well its actually wrong mf, ahhhhhhh
* so what my initial plan was 
    ^ send_res() -> get_mime() -> send_file()
* but now after some serious consideration 
    ^ send_file() -> get_mime() -> send_res()
* anyway not a serious pain in the butt hole
* come on we learn from muiastak :)

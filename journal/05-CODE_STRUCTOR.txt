# Server.c - 1st impt file  ----------------------------------------------

Server* server_create(int port)
- 1st fun to get executed 
- get a port(parameter) 
- create a ipv4 socket with its address that listen for any incomming connection

void server_stop(Server* server)
- set is_running to 0
- will usen in fun like to accept 
- we only accept incommming connection if is_running is 1

# Client.c - next most imp file   ----------------------------------------------

Client* server_accept_client(Server* server)
- accept incomming connection 
- and fill client info like ip/port/timestamp

void client_logs(Client* client)
- log ip/port/timestamp

void client_handle_request(Client* client){
- most impt function in whole code base currnetly 
- get the client reqest in a buffer ( client reqest come from client_file_descriptor )
- send the buffer to a <http_parse_request()> function (will talk about it later)
- handle routing <router_handle_request()>

# Http.c - mostly helper funtion ----------------------------------------------

void http_parse_request(const char* buffer, HttpRequest* request)
- get the buffer parse the request client made (by client i mean browser as we are making a http server we are not writing the client side so we need to follow the http protocol)
- what does a client(browser) sned as a request 

- METHOD 	(Get / Post / Put ...)
- PATH   	( 127.0.0.1:8000/about) /about is a path
- VERSION  	(HTTP 1.1)
- USER_AGENT ...
- HOST     	local host 
- CONTENT_TYPE  ( empty for GET method )
- ONTENT_LENGTH ( 0 for GET method )

void http_send_response(Client* client, HttpResponse* response) 
- now after getting the req what to do 
- send a response like if client is asking for a file send in the response
- HTTP/1.1 200 ok  	just look  http protocol  	 
- Content-Type   	text/plain html json etc
- Content-Length 	the length of file server is sending to client 
- Connection		close alive

- some helper fun needed for sneding response in Router.c
void http_send_html(Client* client, const char* html)
void http_send_text(Client* client, const char* text)
void http_send_json(Client* client, const char* json)
void http_send_error(Client* client, int code, const char* message)

# Router.c -------------------------------------------------------------------

void router_handle_request(Client* client, HttpRequest* request)

- just compare the client request path and path we want (req->path == "/home") 
- for static file we need to used the next fun 

void serve_static_file(Client* client, const char* filename)
- open a file 
- get the content type from another <get_content_type()> like main.txt we get text/plain
- send response same thing we did in route but the thing in route pages are predefile like if we type ...:8000/home we get index.html ------ but in file sending we get a type /index.html we get index.html 



for now its a pretty darn good thing i have acomplish beside the error handling and better code structure and others
plan for future idk im thinking of talking a break its been pretty rough days exam feaver like fuckkk future 
as 18 years i need to start thinking about earining ahhhhhh yeah definetl i will be working it but need some break 
to recover and do some other things like get into architeccture classes i have to loook and shift to arch or debian 
there are so many things get some online exposure
